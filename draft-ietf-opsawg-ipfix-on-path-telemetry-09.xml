      <t>This document specifies new IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      Information Elements to export the On-Path Telemetry measured delay on

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Network operators usually gather and maintain some forms of statistical 
       delay view of their networks (or segments of their networks). That view 
       is meant to help understanding where in the network, for which customer 
       traffic or services, how much, and why abnormal delay is being accumulated. 
       To that aim, delay-related data need to be reported from devices covering 
       both data and control planes.  In order to understand which customer traffic 
       is affected, delay-related data need to be reported into customer data-plane 
       context. That enables network operators to quickly identify when the 
       control-plane updates the current path with a different set of intermediate 
       hops (that is, a change of the forwarding path) and interfaces, how the path 
       delay changes for which customer traffic.</t>

      <t>With On-Path Telemetry, described in the <xref target="RFC9232">
      Network Telemetry Framework</xref> and applied in <xref target="RFC9378">
      In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) Deployment</xref> 
      and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark-deployment">Alternate Marking Deployment
      Framework</xref>, the path delay between two endpoints is measured by
      inserting a timestamp in the packet.</t>

      <t>At least two modes of On-Path Telemetry can be distinguished. Passport
      mode, <xref target="RFC9197"/>, where only the last hop in the
      forwarding path of the On-Path Telemetry domain exposes all the metrics,
      and postcard mode, where the metrics are also exposed in transit nodes. 
      In both modes the forwarding path exposes performance metrics allowing to 
      determine how much delay has been accumulated on which hop.</t>

      <t>In order to export the delay-related metrics via IPIFX <xref target="RFC7011"/>,
      this document defines four new IPFIX Information Elements (IEs),
      exposing the On-Path delay on IOAM transit and decapsulation nodes,
      following the postcard mode principles. Since these IPFIX IEs are
      performance metrics <xref target="RFC8911"/>, they must be registered in
      the <xref target="IANA-PERF-METRIC">"IANA Performance Metric
      Registry</xref>.</t>

      <t>Following the guidelines for Registered Performance Metric Requesters
      and Reviewers <xref target="RFC8911"/>, the different characteristics of
      the performance metrics (Identifier, Name, URI, Status, Requester,
      Revision, Revision Date, Description, etc.) must be clearly specified in
      the <xref target="IANA-PERF-METRIC">"IANA Performance Metric
      Registry</xref> in order for the measurement results using the
      Performance Metrics to be comparable even if they are performed using
      different implementations and in different networks. The first 
      performance metric characteristic is the selection of a meaningful name, 
      following the "MetricType_Method_SubTypeMethod_... Spec_Units_Output" naming
      convention (See Section 7.1.2 of <xref target="RFC8911"/>).</t>

      <t>Assuming time synchronization on devices, the delay is measured by 
      calculating the difference between the timestamp imposed with On-Path 
      Telemetry in the packet at the IOAM encapsulation node and the timestamp 
      exported in the IPFIX flow record from the IOAM transit and decapsulation 
      nodes. The lowest, highest, mean, and/or the sum of measured path delay 
      can be exported, thanks to the different IPFIX IE specifications.</t>

        <t>The mean (average) path delay can be calculated by dividing the
        pathDelaySumDeltaMicroseconds(TBD8) by the packetDeltaCount(2) at the
        IPFIX data collection in order to offload the IPFIX Exporter from
        calculating the mean for every Flow at export time.</t>

      <section anchor="OpsReducedSizeEncoding" title="Reduced-size encoding">
        <t>Unsigned64 has been chosen as type for
        pathDelaySumDeltaMicroseconds to support cases with large delay
        numbers and where many packets are being accounted. As an example, a
        specific Flow Record with path delay of 100 milliseconds cannot
        observe more than 42949 packets without overflowing the unsigned32
        counter. The procedure described in Section 6.2 of <xref
        target="RFC7011"/> may be applied to reduce network bandwidth
        between the IPFIX Exporter and Collector if unsigned32 would be large

        node to calculate the on-path delay. <xref target="RFC9343"/> defines
