      <t>This document specifies new IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
      Information Elements to export the On-Path Telemetry measured
			delay in the OAM transit and decapsulating nodes.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Network operators usually gather and maintain some forms of
      statistical delay view of their networks (or segments of their
      networks). That view is meant to help with understanding where in
			the network, for which customer traffic or services, how much, and
			why abnormal delay is being accumulated. To that aim,
			delay-related data needs to be reported from devices covering both
			data and control planes. In order to understand which customer
			traffic is affected, delay-related data needs to be reported in
			the context of the customer data-plane. That enables network
			operators to quickly identify when the control-plane updates
      the current path with a different set of intermediate hops (that
			is, a change of the forwarding path) and interfaces, how the path
			delay changes for which customer traffic.</t>

      <t>With On-Path Telemetry, described in the <xref
			target="RFC9232"> Network Telemetry Framework</xref> and applied
			in <xref target="RFC9378"> In Situ Operations, Administration, and
			Maintenance (IOAM) Deployment</xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark-deployment">Alternate Marking
			Deployment Framework</xref>, the path delay between two endpoints
			is measured by inserting a timestamp in the packet.</t>

      <t>At least two modes of On-Path Telemetry can be distinguished.
      Passport mode, where only the last hop in the forwarding path of
			the On-Path Telemetry domain exposes all the metrics, and postcard
			mode, where the metrics are also exposed in transit nodes. In both
			modes the forwarding path exposes performance metrics allowing to
			determine how much delay has been accumulated on which hop. The
			proposal in this document makes more sense for the postcard mode.
			</t>

      <t>In order to export the delay-related metrics via IPFIX <xref
      target="RFC7011"/>, this document defines four new IPFIX
			Information Elements (IEs), exposing the On-Path delay on OAM
			transit and decapsulating nodes, following the postcard mode
			principles. Since these IPFIX IEs are performance metrics <xref
			target="RFC8911"/>, they are also registered in the <xref
			target="IANA-PERF-METRIC">"IANA Performance Metric Registry</xref>
			.</t>

      <t>Following the guidelines for Registered Performance Metric
			Requesters and Reviewers <xref target="RFC8911"/>, the different
			characteristics of the performance metrics (Identifier, Name, URI,
			Status, Requester, Revision, Revision Date, Description, etc.)
			must be clearly specified in the <xref target="IANA-PERF-METRIC">
			"IANA Performance Metric Registry</xref> in order for the
			measurement results using the Performance Metrics to be comparable
			even if they are performed using different implementations and in
			different networks. The first performance metric characteristic is
			the selection of a meaningful name, following the
			"MetricType_Method_SubTypeMethod_... Spec_Units_Output" naming
			convention (See <xref section="7.1.2" sectionFormat="of"
      target="RFC8911"/>).</t>

      <t>Assuming time synchronization on devices, the delay is measured
			by calculating the difference between the timestamp imposed with
			On-Path Telemetry in the packet at the OAM encapsulating node and
			the timestamp exported in the IPFIX flow record from the OAM
			transit and decapsulating nodes. The lowest, highest, mean, and/or
			the sum of measured path delay can be exported, thanks to the
			different IPFIX IE specifications.</t>

      <t>In the use case shown in <xref target="topology"/> using
			On-path Telemetry to export the delay metrics, the node R1 exports
			the delay D1, the node R2 exports the delay D2 and the
			decapsulating node R3 exports the total delay D3 for the same flow
			using IPFIX.</t>

      <t>The advantage of this solution is that the delay metrics (min,
			max, and mean) can be computed on the OAM node, and aggregated
			directly within the Flow Record, saving export bandwidth and
			computation on the Collector. For the computation of the min, max,
			and mean delay metric to be computed locally on the OAM node, the
			exporter Metering Process requires some local caching/processing
			computation (for each new packets in the flow), specifically the
			mean value when Flow Aggregation <xref target="RFC7015"/> is being
			used. A less computational heavy solution for the OAM node
			is the export of the delay sum instead of the delay mean; on the
			Collector, the delay mean can easily be computed by a single
			division operation (using the packet count). The alternative, with
			no delay monitoring on the OAM node, requires the export of every
			single packet as a separate Flow Record, including the timestamps
			information, as described in <xref
			target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-alt-mark"/> for Alternate Marking,
      for the Collector to compute delay metrics (min, max, and mean),
      before recomputing the aggregated Flow Record.</t>

        <t>The same recommendation as defined in <xref section="4.5"
        sectionFormat="of" target="RFC5153"/> for IPFIX applies in terms
				of clock precision to this document as well.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="OpsMeanDelay" title="Mean Delay">
        <t>The mean (average) path delay can be calculated by dividing
				the pathDelaySumDeltaMicroseconds(TBD8) by the
				packetDeltaCount(2) at the IPFIX data collection in order to
				offload the IPFIX Exporter from calculating the mean for every
				Flow at export time.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="OpsReducedSizeEncoding" title="Reduced-size
			encoding">
        <t>Unsigned64 has been chosen as type for
        pathDelaySumDeltaMicroseconds to support cases with large delay
        numbers and where many packets are being accounted. As an
				example, a specific Flow Record with path delay of 100
				milliseconds cannot observe more than 42949 packets without 
				overflowing the unsigned32 counter. The procedure described in
				<xref section="6.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC7011"/> may be
				applied to reduce network bandwidth between the IPFIX Exporter
				and Collector if unsigned32 would be large enough without
				wrapping around.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="MeasurementInterval"
			title="Measurement Interval">
        <t>The delay metrics are computed for the Flow Record life time 
		     by comparing the OAM timestamps in each received packet with
				 the timestamp when they were received. For long-running Flow, 
				 we might miss the temporal distribution of the delay (for
				 example, a longer delay only at the beginning of Flow). If this
				 is an operational problem, the IPFIX Metering Process might be
				 configured with a smaller expiration timeout (see Section
				 5.1.1. Flow Expiration <xref target="RFC5470"/>).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="OpsIoamApplication" title="In-Packet
			OAM Application">
        <t>Multiple methods can be used to compute the delay performance
        metrics defined in this document. Some examples of such methods
				are IOAM <xref target="RFC9197"/> and Enhanced Alternate Marking
				<xref target="I-D.zhou-ippm-enhanced-alternate-marking"/>.</t>

        <t>For IOAM, these performance metrics can be computed using the
        Edge-to-Edge and the Direct Exporting Option-Type.</t>

        <t>IOAM Edge-to-Edge Option-Type, as described in <xref
				section="4.6" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9197"/>, can use
				bits 2 and 3. In this case, timestamps are encoded as defined in
				Section 4.4.2.3 and 4.4.2.4 of <xref target="RFC9197"/>. This
				timestamp can be used to compute the delay between the
				encapsulating node and the decapsulating node.</t>

        <t>IOAM Direct Exporting Option-Type, as described in <xref
        target="RFC9326"/>, can use the Extension-Flag defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext"/> to insert a
				timestamp in the encapsulating node. The timestamp is encoded as
				defined in Section 4.4.2.3 and 4.4.2.4 of <xref
				target="RFC9197"/>. This timestamp can be used to compute the
				delay between the inserted timestamp and the transit and
				decapsulating node.</t>

        <t>For the Enhanced Alternate Marking Method, <xref section="2"
        sectionFormat="of"
				target="I-D.zhou-ippm-enhanced-alternate-marking"/> and <xref
				section="3.2" sectionFormat="of"
				target="I-D.fz-spring-srv6-alt-mark"/> defines that, within the
				metaInfo, a nanosecond timestamp can be encoded in the
				encapsulating node and be read at the intermediate and
				decapsulating node to calculate the on-path delay. <xref
				target="RFC9343"/> defines how this can be applied to the
        IPv6 options header and <xref
				target="I-D.fz-spring-srv6-alt-mark"/> defines how this can be
				applied to the SRv6 Segment Routing Header.</t>

        <t>Given that the delay measurements are computed with the
				timestamp introduced on the encapsulating node, regardless of
				the approach, implementations should document at which point of
				the forwarding plane this timestamp is introduced (e.g. the time
				at which the packet was received by the node, the time at which
				the packet was transmitted by the node, etc.). Based on this
				information, different actions can be taken.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The IPFIX Information Elements introduced in this document do
			not directly introduce security issues. Rather, they define a set
			of performance metrics that may, for privacy or business issues,
			be considered sensitive information.</t>

      <t>For example, exporting delay metrics may make attacks possible
			for the receiver of this information; this would otherwise only be
			possible for direct observers of the reported Flows along the data
			path.</t>

      <t>The underlying protocol used to exchange the information
			described here must therefore apply appropriate procedures to
			guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of the exported
			information. These protocols are defined in separate documents,
			specifically the IPFIX protocol document <xref target="RFC7011"/>.
